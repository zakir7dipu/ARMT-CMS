                Abdur Rahim Memorial Trust is one such organization. Working on a plethora of projects aimed at improving the quality of life of those who desperately need such assistance, the Trust has expanded from its humble beginnings to become a reliable charity organization. It’s an initiative by the owners of Super Star Group for the memory of their late father Mr. Abdur Rahim.</p>

With 57 pumps installed across Bangladesh, the trust has brought fresh, potable water to countless people across the country.

ARMT’s reliable Ambulance and Hearse Services have been trying to combat this by providing the service for free for the people who are in need.
